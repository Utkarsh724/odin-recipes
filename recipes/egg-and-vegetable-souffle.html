        <h2>Believe it or not, the most difficult part of this recipe is using the microwave.</h2>
        <p>The microwave is a handy tool, especially when it comes to cooking muscle-building eggs. If you donâ€™t have spinach on hand, then add whatever you have 
            in the fridge. For veggies like broccoli and cauliflower, chop before adding. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 handful baby spinach</li>
            <li>1 small handful crushed Rice Chex</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to Make it</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine and whisk eggs</li>
            <li>Spray a small ramekin or glass bowl with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Layer crushed Chex first, then spinach and pour whisked egg mixture to cover. Give it a quick stir. </li>
            <li>Microwave on medium-high heat for 2-2 1/2 minutes; stopping 1 time to stir. Let cool and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
